# MedCore AI Platform

## 🧠 Project Vision

MedCore AI Platform is a plugin-oriented medical image processing system designed to support AI-based analysis of MRI, CT, and X-ray images.

The platform aims to provide:
- Modular AI integration
- Scalable backend architecture
- Research-friendly design
- Future LLM integration

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Current medical AI systems are often:
- Model-specific
- Hard to extend
- Not modular
- Not plugin-ready

MedCore solves this by introducing a Core-Based + Plugin-Oriented Architecture.

---

## 👤 Target Users

- AI Researchers
- Medical Imaging Students
- HealthTech Developers
- Future Clinical Integrators

---

## 🚀 MVP 1 Scope

The first MVP will include:
- X-ray image upload
- Basic classification model
- API endpoint for prediction
- Simple frontend interface
- Dockerized backend

---

## ❌ Out of Scope (Phase 0-1)

- 3D volumetric MRI processing
- PACS integration
- Federated learning
- Clinical validation
- Multi-modal fusion

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Direction

Core-Based + Plugin-Oriented System
Client (Frontend) ↓ API Layer (Backend) ↓ Core Engine ↓ Plugin Manager ↓ AI Plugins (Classification / Segmentation / Detection) ↓ Database & Storage

---

## 📌 Development Phases

- Phase 0 – System Architecture & Foundation  
- Phase 1 – Classification MVP  
- Phase 2 – Segmentation  
- Phase 3 – Real Plugin System  
- Phase 4 – LLM Integration  
- Phase 5 – DevOps & Dockerization
